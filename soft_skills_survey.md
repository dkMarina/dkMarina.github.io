## Soft Skills in Science: What Really Counts?

Over the last few years â€” in labs, classrooms, and freelance work â€” Iâ€™ve come to believe that beyond technical know-how, two traits matter most in early-career scientific roles:

1. Being someone people enjoy working with â€” collaborative, open, and kind  
2. Learning fast and applying smart â€” adapting quickly and solving problems effectively

âœ¨ But is that really what employers look for?

To find out, I created a short (2-minute), anonymous survey:

### Why this project?

This mini scientific survey is designed to help:

- **Young scientists** understand what really matters to employers beyond the hard skills
- **Early-career applicants** improve their job documents and interview prep
- **Team leads & hiring managers** reflect on how they evaluate soft skills

### Who is it for?

- Recent graduates and early-career scientists in life sciences
- Hiring managers, HR professionals, or team leads working with young scientists
- Educators and science communicators interested in career readiness

### Goals

- Gather data on the soft skills most valued in young talent
- Share transparent, actionable insights with the community
- Promote human, team-friendly qualities in science careers

### Coming Soon

ðŸ“Š Results will be published publicly â€” right here and on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryna-aumayr-71110b93/)
