### Soft Skills in Science: What Really Counts?

 What do teams really value when hiring or onboarding young scientists?  

To find out, I created a short (2-minute), anonymous survey:

#### Why this project?

This mini scientific survey is designed to help:

- **Young scientists** understand what really matters to employers beyond the hard skills
- **Early-career applicants** improve their job documents and interview prep
- **Team leads & hiring managers** reflect on how they evaluate soft skills

### Methodology

**Title:** Soft Skills Survey for Your Life Science Roles

**Goal:**  
The survey was created to gather information on which soft skills and personal qualities are most valued by professionals in the life sciences field when hiring or collaborating with early-career specialists.

**Audience:**  
The survey targets team leads, hiring managers, and talent acquisition professionals primarily within the life sciences sector.

**Method:**  
The survey is a brief, anonymous online questionnaire designed for quick completion. It combines quantitative ranking questions and qualitative open-ended prompts to capture both prioritized soft skills and deeper insights from respondents. Additional questions classify participants by their professional background to contextualize the results.

The survey is being shared via professional networks, social media platforms, and personal outreach to relevant contacts in the life sciences field. Once responses are collected, the data will be analyzed statistically and visualized to highlight key patterns and insights.

ðŸ“Š The results will be published openly â€” both here and on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryna-aumayr-71110b93/)  â€” to support greater transparency in the hiring process and help early-career scientists better understand what truly matters to employers.
