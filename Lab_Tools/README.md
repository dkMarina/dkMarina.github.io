# Lab Tools â€“ Excel-Based Projects

This folder contains Excel tools developed to support laboratory workflows during my Bachelor thesis and protein purification lab projects.

## Files:

- **IF_and_PCR_Solution_Tools.xlsx**  
  Contains sheets for Immunofluorescence staining solution preparation, PCR master mix preparations, and related calculations.

- **Bradford_and_StandardCurve_Calculators.xlsx**  
  Includes templates for protein quantification with Bradford assay and standard curve plotting for experimental data analysis.

## Why Excel?
These Excel tools were designed for:

-  Fast and reliable calculations during lab work
-  Reducing manual errors in reagent preparation
-  Improving experimental documentation
-  Supporting team members with or without coding experience
