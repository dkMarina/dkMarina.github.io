**Why should you hire me?**  

Why not? Sounds like a win!  
You’re not just after someone to quietly fit in—  

Someone who blends with the team — but still stands tall,  
Who asks the tough questions and does not drop the ball.  

Biotech and language? I juggle both with flair,  
Bringing clarity and insight everywhere.  

PCR, cloning — I know the score,  
In the lab and beyond, I deliver more.  

Ten years of experience? I’ll pass on that boast,  
Curiosity, calm, and smarts matter most.  

When your candidate pool feels crowded and dense,  
Your choice will be clear — and guess who makes sense?  
**Spoiler alert: it’s me, no pretense!**

I wrote this poem as a creative take on the classic "Why should we hire you?" question — blending biotech, language, and mindset into one short pitch.

 Because applying for jobs shouldn't mean hiding your voice.
 Especially when your voice is your value.
