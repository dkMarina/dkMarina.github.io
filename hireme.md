Welcome to my **“Why Hire Me”** page - a space where I share a creative reflection on what I bring to **your** team. This page is about voice, originality, and how I think — **which** goes far beyond a list of skills in my CV.

I wrote this poem as a creative take on the classic  
*“Why should we hire you?”* question — blending biotech, language, and mindset into one short pitch.

### Why should you hire me?

Why not? Sounds like a win!  
You’re not just after someone to quietly fit in—  

Someone who blends with the team — but still stands tall,  
Who asks the tough questions and does not drop the ball.  

Biotech and language? I juggle both with flair,  
Bringing clarity and insight everywhere.  

PCR and cloning — I know the score,  
In the lab and beyond, I deliver more.  

Ten years of experience? I’ll pass on that boast,  
Curiosity, calm, and smarts matter most.  

When your candidate pool feels crowded and dense,  
Your choice will be clear — and guess who makes sense?  
<br>
**Spoiler alert: it’s me, no pretense!**
