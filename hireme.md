## Why should you hire me?

Because you're looking for someone who fits into the team – but doesn’t disappear in it.  
Someone who doesn’t pretend to know everything – but knows how to ask the right questions.

I may not be a PowerPoint wizard, but I’ve contributed to research projects across languages and labs – from Austria to South Korea – and adapted fast, even when things got complex.

I’m a trained microbiology technologist with a background in linguistics – which means I think analytically, communicate precisely, and see patterns others might miss.

I don’t bring “ten years of experience” – but I do bring curiosity, common sense, and a calm head under pressure.  
I’m no expert in everything, but I know how to learn – and I actually enjoy doing it.

Also, I work confidently with Excel, Python, and R – not to show off, but to solve real problems with real data.

And finally:  
If you're looking for someone who doesn’t take herself too seriously – but takes the work seriously – then I might be exactly who you’re looking for.
