Welcome to my **Selected Projects** â€” a curated set of handsâ€‘on builds that put theory to work.  
From wetâ€‘lab autophagy assays to R/Python data pipelines, GxP documentation, and a lightweight LIMS prototype, each project spotlights realâ€‘world skills, clear results, and my drive to keep learning by doing.

### Bachelor Team Project: GxP Pharmaceutical Operations  
_As part of my studies_ â€” collaborated on a simulated launch of a [GMP-compliant pharmaceutical company](/assets/Variae.png).  
Key contributions:  

- Designing the company logo to establish a professional brand identity
- Coordinating and facilitating team meetings to ensure efficient collaboration
- Drafting and presenting audit milestone scripts that guided compliance reviews
- Developing essential  [GMP documents](/assets/SOP.png), including SOPs, organizational charts, and risk analyses
- _Experience gained_: pharmaceutical quality systems, team collaboration, regulatory compliance.

### Internship Project â€“ Center for Genome Engineering, IBS Korea  
Bachelor thesis & internship focused on stem cell immune evasion and developing a [tfâ€‘LC3 reporter mouse model](/assets/tf-LC3.png) to monitor autophagy in GI tissues.  
Key skills and techniques:  
- PCR genotyping & mouse tissue preparation  
- Immunohistochemistry (IHC) & immunofluorescence (IF) staining  
- Confocal microscopy imaging & analysis  
- 3D oral epithelial cell culture  
- Organized structured lab reporting

Explore the [Excel-based Lab Tools](./Lab_Tools) I developed to support IF staining workflows, PCR master mix preparations,  as part of my bachelor thesis and internship projects.

## Lab Tools â€“ Excel-Based Projects

Explore Excel-based calculation and analysis tools I developed to support laboratory workflows as part of my internship, lab-based courses, and Bachelor thesis experiments. These tools include Immunofluorescence (IF) staining solution preparation, CR Master Mix preparations, and protein quantification using Bradford assay.

- [Lab Tools Repository](./Lab_Tools) â€” Contains practical Excel sheets used during real lab projects to enhance organization, accuracy, and reproducibility.
