Welcome to my **Selected Projects** — a curated set of hands‑on builds that put theory to work.  
From wet‑lab autophagy assays to R/Python data pipelines, GxP documentation, and a lightweight LIMS prototype, each project spotlights real‑world skills, clear results, and my drive to keep learning by doing.

### Team Project: 🛡️ GxP Pharmaceutical Operations  

_During my bachelor’s degree program_ — collaborated on a simulated launch of a [GMP-compliant pharmaceutical company](/assets/Variae.png).  
Key contributions:  
- Designing the company logo to establish a professional brand identity
- Coordinating and facilitating team meetings to ensure efficient collaboration
- Drafting and presenting audit milestone scripts that guided compliance reviews
- Developing essential  [GMP documents](/assets/SOP.png), including SOPs, organizational charts, and risk analyses

_Experience gained_: pharmaceutical quality systems, team collaboration, regulatory compliance.

### 🧪 Lab Tools 
  
#### Excel-Based Projects

Explore Excel-based calculation and analysis tools I developed to support laboratory workflows as part of my internship, lab-based courses, and Bachelor thesis experiments. These tools include Immunofluorescence (IF) staining solution preparation, PCR master mix preparations, and protein quantification using Bradford assay ([Lab Tools Examples](https://dkMarina.github.io/assets/Lab_Tools/)).

### 📊 Soft Skills in Science – Micro-Survey Project

- On July 25, 2025, I launched a short, anonymous survey to gather real input from team leaders and hiring professionals on which soft skills and personal qualities are most valued when starting out in life sciences.
