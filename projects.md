Welcome to my **Selected Projects** â€” a curated set of handsâ€‘on builds that put theory to work.  
From wetâ€‘lab autophagy assays to R/Python data pipelines, GxP documentation, and a lightweight LIMS prototype, each project spotlights realâ€‘world skills, clear results, and my drive to keep learning by doing.
