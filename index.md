#### From ABCD to ATCG — An Interdisciplinary Bridge to Biotech Innovation

Hi, I’m **Maryna Aumayr** — a [molecular biotechnology](assets/Curlum.png) graduate bringing a linguist’s eye for detail, a teacher’s communication skills, and a scientist’s analytical mindset.
I pivoted from the world of words to the language of life sciences, combining creativity, precision, and data-driven thinking.  
Whether it's PCR in the lab, R code in RStudio, or decoding regulatory jargon — I’m all in.
