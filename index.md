#### From ABCD to ATCG — Where Grammar Meets Genomes 

Hi, I’m **Maryna Aumayr** — a [molecular biotechnology](assets/Curlum.png) graduate bringing a linguist’s eye for detail, a teacher’s communication skills, and a scientist’s analytical mindset.
I pivoted from the world of words to the language of life sciences, combining creativity, precision, and data-driven thinking.  
Whether it's PCR in the lab, R code in RStudio, or decoding regulatory jargon — I’m all in.

#### 📊 Micro Research Project: What Really Counts in Life Science Careers?

What soft skills matter most for young professionals entering biotech and life sciences?

I've launched a short, anonymous survey (about 2 minutes) to learn from people in the field — hiring managers, team leads, and early-career scientists alike.

💬 **Your input helps:**
- Young scientists prepare more effectively for real job expectations
- Build transparency between teams and job seekers
- Guide better career conversations
