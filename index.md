# From ABCD to ATCG — Welcome

Hi, I’m **Maryna Aumayr** — a molecular biotechnology graduate with a linguist’s mind, a teacher’s heart, and a scientist’s curiosity.  
I pivoted from the world of words to the language of life sciences, combining creativity, precision, and data-driven thinking.  
Whether it's PCR in the lab, R code in RStudio, or decoding regulatory jargon — I’m all in.
